# ðŸŽ¨ Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow Hub

This project performs **Neural Style Transfer** using a **pre-trained TensorFlow Hub model** to combine the content of one image with the artistic style of another.

âœ… Built and tested in **Google Colab**.  
âœ… Uses **TensorFlow** and **TensorFlow Hub**.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Upload any **content image** (e.g., a photo of a person, animal, or object).
- Upload any **style image** (e.g., artwork, painting, or texture).
- The model blends the two to create a **stylized image**.
- Optional **sharpening** enhances details in the output.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib & Pillow for visualization and image processing

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use (Step by Step)

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. Run each code cell one by one.

3. When prompted:
   - Upload your **Content Image** (the photo you want to transform).
   - Upload your **Style Image** (the artwork/style to apply).

4. The notebook will display and save the **stylized output image**.
